## Scammer Alert

This projects aims at being the building ground for open source projects against **_scammers_** who over phone, email and other social media deceive targets and oftentimes estorc money or any other valuable assets.

We will first have this online directory of reported numbers, emails and social media accounts with evidence of either atempted or successful scams.  
In this way, if someone has a doubt about a new number, he/she can simply check on the website or emit a reserve.


### Further works
- Build a mobile plugin for blocking or signaling the incoming call might be from a number used for scamming.
- Build a self moderating platform for checking spam reports
